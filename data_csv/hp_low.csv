“What the hell just happened?” Bella hissed at me from across the table.
I looked down the Slytherin table.
"Lucius Malfoy, my fellow prefect, was wearing an expression on his face that was a cross between sympathy and amusement."
Narcissa looked as if she was about to vomit.
"“The hat put him into Gryffindor,” I replied in a matter of fact voice."
“I know he was sorted into Gryffindor I’m not blind Andromeda.”
"“Well, you did ask...”"
"I know just how irritating I was being, and I stand by it."
I was not about to let a Bellatrix Black temper tantrum ruin the glow of my first night as a prefect.
"She had obviously, and predictably, taken the result of Sirius’ sorting as a personal offense."
Bella continued to mutter angrily and slightly threateningly under her breath until Professor McGonagall shot her a filthy look.
Professor McGonagall was no fan of Bella’s.
"Bellatrix completely ignored McGonagall’s glare, so I, seeing no other option, kicked her under the table."
That shut her up.
I didn’t really pay attention to the rest of the Sorting.
I had no reason to now that Sirius had been sorted.
"Of course, I greeted every new Slytherin as befitted a prefect, but I didn’t pay attention in between new Slytherins."
Most of my concentration that evening was on keeping Bella from marching over to the Gryffindor table and making a scene.
"I was mildly successful, and Bella agreed to hold off on her “discussion” with Sirius until the following morning."
That “discussion” was the reason for my presence outside of Gryffindor Tower on the first morning of the new term.
I thought it my duty to warn Sirius of the explosion making its way up from the dungeons.
He emerged from his common room about ten minutes after my arrival.
"He was flanked by three boys, none of whom I paid much attention to."
"I would like to say that my first encounter with Remus Lupin stands out clearly in my mind, but really, all it left was a vague impression of brown hair and an honest smile."
"I warned Sirius of Bella’s approach, and Sirius managed to avoid her until late in the afternoon."
The resulting argument wasn’t pretty; their arguments never were.
The argument progressed along predictable lines: Sirius was disgracing the family and Bellatrix was blaming him for something he claimed to not have much control over
"(I always suspected that he had nudged the hat away from putting him in Slytherin, but I never discussed it with him)."
