Kumiko Toga was not having a good day.
"First, her older sister was kicked out of their own house unjustly by her parents, so she ran away from home to accompany her and make sure Himiko didn’t die."
"She knew that if she returned, her parents would punish her for running away, and that was not exactly the most ideal situation."
"This caused some problems: no money, no shelter, no food or water."
"Himiko proposed that they steal food and other necessities from stores, but Kumiko didn’t like the idea of stealing from smaller stores and managed to convince her sister to only steal from people who could afford to lose some money."
"They set up a shelter tucked into an alleyway using anything waterproof or durable that they could find in a dumpster nearby, and luckily they had also found some old blankets and fabric they could use for bedding."
"A few months from then, Kumiko managed to get a job moving boxes for a nearby shop, disguised as a young boy she’d seen on the streets once."
"She didn’t know his quirk, but she just told the shopkeeper that it was a minor quirk that let him see slightly better and got away with it."
"There were a few slip-ups where she forgot what she’d called herself or what the boy had looked like, but the shopkeeper was not very observant and she got good money for her job."
"By now, they were living easier than before, having three meals a day, plenty of water, and some extra money to spare."
"Kumiko bought a simple cap to cover her hair at work (her disguises only lasted for so long without training and she had very little endurance, and she soon found out that they began dissolving from top down - thus the hat), and Himiko bought herself a cheap winter coat, as it was starting to get chilly in the city."
Kumiko had a gut feeling that something was going to go wrong today.
"She brushed it off as nerves, but a few hours later the roaring engine of a car and crashing could be heard from outside their shelter."
Kumiko peeked outside to see a flaming hero chasing a man holding some sort of remote.
"Stopping in front of their alleyway, the escaping man began scaling the wall of the multi-story building to their right, and the hero followed."
"The man held out the remote and seemed to shout something to the hero from the roof, but the hero continued to scale the wall and shot himself all the way to the top with a large blast of fire."
"Kumiko shielded her eyes, not used to the brightness of the flames, but snapped them open again when she heard a deafening BOOM from the building the man had been standing on moments before."
The building exploded and began to crumble down just a few feet from their home.
Kumiko quickly grabbed a sleepy Himiko and started to run.
"They sprinted as fast as they could, but before they made it to the open street a large chunk of concrete began to fall from right above them."
"Himiko stumbled, her hand slipping away from Kumiko’s, and she screamed for Himiko as she dove out of the way of the falling debris."
